# README for API Installation
[Back to root README](README.md)
[Read about working with WeVoteServer](README_WORKING_WITH_WE_VOTE_SERVER.md)

NOTE: We are running Django version 1.8

NOTE: WeVoteServer is built for Python 3.4. It currently still works with Python version 2.7.6.
(tests still have issues with Python 3.4, but everything else works)

## Clone WeVoteServer from github

Create a place to put all of the code from Github:

    $ mkdir /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonProjects/

Retrieve “WeVoteServer” into that folder.

## Installing Python 3

Mac instructions (Based on [this](http://joebergantine.com/blog/2015/apr/30/installing-python-2-and-python-3-alongside-each-ot/))

Install Python 3.4 from package: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
This allows you to run python3 and pip3. 
(Software gets installed into /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/.)

    $ pip3 install --user virtualenv
    $ vim ~/.bash_profile

Add the following to .bash_profile, save and quit:

    alias virtualenv3='~/Library/Python/3.4/bin/virtualenv'

Update the current Terminal window to use the alias you just saved:

    $ source ~/.bash_profile

Create a place for the virtual environment to live on your hard drive. We recommend installing it 
outside of "PythonProjects" folder:

    $ mkdir /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonEnvironments/
    $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonEnvironments/
    $ virtualenv3 WeVoteServer3.4

Now activate this new virtual environment for WeVoteServer:

    $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonProjects/WeVoteServer/
    $ source /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonEnvironments/WeVoteServer3.4/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python manage.py runserver

### Running Linux?
If you are installing on a Linux environment, we recommend the following steps within your virtual environment. If you
are installing on a Mac or Windows machine, you can skip these steps.

DO:

    sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2 
    sudo apt-get install python-dev
    pip install psycopg2 

THEN:

    pip install django-toolbelt
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setup - Install the Postgres database

### METHOD 1 (Mac)
For Mac, download and install the DMG from [http://postgresapp.com/](http://postgresapp.com/)

Run this on your command line:

    export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin

Start up the command line for postgres (there is an 'open psql' button/navigation item if you installed postgresapp.
Run these commands:

    create role postgres;
    alter role postgres with login;

### METHOD 2 (Windows)

Install Postgres:

    $ sudo port install postgresql94
    $ sudo port install postgresql94-server

### METHOD 3 (linux Ubuntu)

Follow [these instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL)

## Setup - Install PG Admin III

We recommend installing pgAdmin3 as a WYSIWYG database administration tool.
NOTE: You may need to turn off the restriction in "Security & Privacy" on "unidentified developers"
to allow this tool to be installed.
See: http://blog.tcs.de/program-cant-be-opened-because-it-is-from-an-unidentified-developer/

In pgadmin add a server. You can use your sign in name as the server name.


## Setup - Environment Variables Configuration - config/environment_variables.json

WeVoteServer is currently configured (in manage.py) to look for a "config/local.py" file (configured in the
"config/settings.py" file). When we run this on a production server, we will startup with a production settings
file like "production_heroku.py".

Copy "environment_variables-template.json" to "environment_variables.json". You will configure many variables for your
local environment in this file. New variables needed by WeVoteServer will be added to
"environment_variables-template.json" from time to time, so please check for updates by comparing your local version
with the template file.

### LOG_FILE
Create a file on your computer to match the one expected in the environment_variables.json file:

    sudo mkdir /var/log/wevote/
    sudo touch /var/log/wevote/wevoteserver.log
    sudo chmod -R 0777 /var/log/wevote/

As configured in github, only errors get written to the log.
Logging has five levels: CRITICAL, ERROR, INFO, WARN, DEBUG.
It works as a hierarchy (i.e. INFO picks up all messages logged as INFO, ERROR and CRITICAL), and when logging we
specify the level assigned to each message. You can change this to info items by changing this:

    LOG_FILE_LEVEL = logging.INFO

## Set up GeoIP

###  Install the C library

Start by changing directories into your WeVoteServer folder:

    $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonProjects/WeVoteServer/
    $ git clone https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-c.git
    $ cd geoip-api-c
    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    
In the "make check" step, you may see some errors like "make[2]: * [install-libLTLIBRARIES] Error 1". 
These errors won't prevent geoip from working.
    
    $ make check
    $ make install
    $ cd ..
    
On OS X 10.10.5 I got an error (autoreconf: command not found), and had to do this first:
    
    $ brew install automake
    $ brew install libtool
    
    
#### “libGeoIP.so.1: cannot open..."
On Amazon Linux (Fedora), if you get a “libGeoIP.so.1: cannot open shared object No such file or directory” error 
when you run WeVoteServer:

    $ sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf
    
Add on a new line:

    /usr/local/lib
     
Then run:

    $ sudo ldconfig


###  Run the command that downloads the GeoLite database from the WeVoteServer root folder (Where this README lives)

    $ ./manage.py update_geoip_data
    
### On Amazon Web Services

Buy the latest database ("GEO-133	GeoIP Legacy City with DMA/Area Codes") at http://www.maxmind.com

Find and copy the GZIP download link from this page https://www.maxmind.com/en/download_files which will look like:

    https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download?edition_id=133&date=20160517&suffix=tar.gz&license_key=KEYHERE

Transfer it to the live API server:
    
    $ cd /home/wevote/WeVoteServer/geoip/import_data/
    $ wget "https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download? (FILL IN ACTUAL LINK FROM THEIR DOWNLOADS PAGE)"
    $ mv geoip_download\?edition_id\=133\&date\=20160202 GeoIP-133_DATE_HERE.tar.gz
    $ chmod 0777 GeoIP-133_DATE_HERE.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf GeoIP-133_DATE_HERE.tar.gz
    $ cp GeoIP-133_20160202/GeoIPCity.dat .
    $ chmod 0777 *.*

## Test that WeVoteServer is running

Start up the webserver:

    $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonProjects/WeVoteServer/
    $ source /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonEnvironments/WeVoteServer3.4/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python manage.py runserver

Find admin tools here:

    http://localhost:8000/admin
    
Now you will need to authenticate as an admin. For now, this will require that you log in with your Twitter account.

    Click "Sign in with Twitter" and use your Twitter credentials to Sign-In. 
    
After you have signed in, you will see an error message in red that states "You must sign in with account that has
Verified Volunteer rights to see that page." Just below the error message, there will be a field "id" with a number next
to it, note the id number.

Open PG Admin III and navigate to:

    Server Groups > Servers > WeVoteServerDB 

Double click on WeVoteServerDB (there may be a red x thru it). It will prompt you for a password; leave it blank and click
OK. You may see an additional warning screen about saving passwords, if so, click ok. Once you are connected, navigate to:

    WeVoteServerDB > Schemas > public > Tables > voter_voter

Then, right click, and in the menu that appears, select:

    View Data > View Top 100 rows

In the new window that opens, scroll down and find the id number, noted above. Scroll to the right to locate the box
"is_adminboolean" click on it once, and a box will appear, click it and change it to TRUE. Then, go back to your browser, 
and click on:

    Back to Admin Home
    
Now, you can access the admin tools. 

Find documentation for all of the APIs here:

    http://localhost:8000/apis/v1/docs

## Setup - Database Creation

If you would like to match the local database settings from the "config/environment_variables.json" file,
(Search for "DATABASES"):

    createdb WeVoteServerDB

Populate your database with the latest database tables:

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

Create the initial database:

    $ python manage.py syncdb

When prompted for a super user, enter your email address and a simple password. This admin account is only used in development.

If you are not prompted to create a superuser, run the following command:

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    
## Sample data
Sample data is provided. Go here:

    http://localhost:8000/admin
    
Find the "Import Test Data" link (in the "Maintenance" section), and click it. This initial import can take 2-3 minutes.
 
### Google Civic
In order to retrieve fresh ballot data, you will need to sign up for a Google Civic API key:

  - Go here:  https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials?pli=1
  - Create a new project
  - Click Credentials -> New credentials -> API Key -> Browser Key
  - Check to make sure the "Google Civic Information API" is enabled here: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/enabled?project=atomic-router-681
  - If you don't see it, go here and search for "Google Civic": https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library?project=atomic-router-681
  - When you find it, click the "Enable API" button.
  - Copy your newly generated key and paste it into config/environment_variables.json as the value for GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY
  
### Vote Smart
We also have a paid subscription with Vote Smart. You can sign up for a 
[Vote Smart developer key](http://votesmart.org/share/api/register#.VrIx4VMrJhE), or reach out to 
Dale.McGrew@WeVoteUSA.org to discuss using our organizational account.

  - Copy your Vote Smart key and paste it into config/environment_variables.json as the value for VOTE_SMART_API_KEY
  
### Twitter
Instructions coming soon.
  
### Running import scripts
Although we keep https://api.wevoteusa.org up-to-date with the latest data from Google Civic, Vote Smart & Twitter, you
may need to pull data into your local development environment in order to work on certain areas of WebApp. These are
the steps.

Save an address:

    1. Go here: http://localhost:8000/apis/v1/docs/
    2. Go here, and enter a full address near an upcoming election (ex: "2208 Ebb Tide Rd, Virginia Beach, VA 23451"): http://localhost:8000/apis/v1/docs/voterAddressSave/
    3. You should get a status back equal to something like "VOTER_ADDRESS_SAVED"

Verify you have the candidates you expect:

    1. Go to "Candidates" here: http://localhost:8000/c/
    2. Filter by Election
    3. Click "Retrieve Candidate Photos for this Election"

Import some positions:

    1. Go to "Positions / Public Opinions" here: http://localhost:8000/pos/
    2. Filter by Election
    3. Click "Retrieve Positions from Vote Smart for this Election". This process can take 4-5 minutes.
    4. Click "Generate Voter Guides"

## Setup - Heroku Configuration

NOTE: These instructions are in progress and currently out-of-date.

We use Heroku for publishing a public version anyone can play with , and you can publish a public version too. Here are the instructions:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-django

In the config/setting.py file, search for "Heroku". There are comments that tell you which parts of the settings file to comment or uncomment to get a version running on Heroku.
